Modern cities are complex structures, in which the methods of functional zoning and designing for several years ahead are used. However, the problems of chaotic building positioning and undeveloped infrastructure are still acute worldwide. The root cause of these issues appears even at the stage of site plan design.
Finding a method that can provide a modern approach to urban design is necessary, considering all building requirements and other vital aspects, such as residents' comfort and ecologically friendly solutions.

It was hypothesized that plane tessellations help achieve the purpose. The primary theoretical information about Archimedean tessellations, Voronoi diagram, and Delaunay triangulation was systematized, and the study on the possibilities of use of them in urban design was carried out. 
It was determined that the main problem of the project could be reduced to the mathematical problem of plane tessellation with appropriate constraints. 

The mathematical methods of designing building arrangements, infrastructure and area zoning were outlined. The software based on them was developed. It consists of the generation of building arrangements; visualization of them; the procedure of checking for optimality, namely, a search of straight-through lines inside the site plan; methods of the Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulation construction for designing infrastructure inside the residential area. Python and C++ programming languages were chosen for the development.

The software was tested, and an example of the master plan of the residential complex was created. The residential complex comprises $10$ houses, the area is $3.5$ hectares, and it can accommodate up to $2000$ residents. There are $5$ elements of soft infrastructure and $5$ green zones.
Unified algorithms and methods can be used to construct new residential complexes, neighborhoods, residential areas, and settlements, considering building requirements, smart city concepts, optimal positioning of all elements, and residents' comfort. 
Planning residential areas according to the outlined principles and algorithms makes it possible to create a smart city that will be comprehensively developed in all aspects and functional for its residents.
